					<h2>Choosing a Jump</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						Help topics can include graphics and text that link to other Help
						topics or to more information about the current topic. These are
						called jumps.
					</p>
					<p>
						Jumps are usually identified by a color and an underline
						(unless the jump is a graphic). When you point to a jump, the
						<code>pointer<span class="tooltip"><b>pointer</b>
							The arrow-shaped cursor on the screen that follows the movement of a mouse (or other pointing devices) and
							indicates which area of the screen will be affected when you press the mouse button. The pointer may change

						appears in the Help window. Sometimes a jump is linked to
						information that appears in a pop-up window or a secondary
						window.
					</p>
					<p>
						Note: When information is displayed in a pop-up window, the
						size of the pop-up window is proportional to the size of
						the main Help window. If you want the pop-up window to

						window.
