						new Sensation! You'll experience a new, interactive world of vibrant graphics and animations,
						true digital stereo sound, instant access to volumes of infomation and practical
						easy to use applications. Sensation also comes with a huge library of ready-to-use
						information on CD-ROM discs! And don't worry about having to learn to run Windows
						-- the included WinMate software makes Windows so easy, the entire family will feel
						right at home with Sensation. Each family member can actually "customize" WinMate to
						their liking. That means the kids can go right to the included Encyclopedia or Atlas
						without ever disturbing your personal finance files. If you work at home, you'll love Sensation!
